1.1	Abstract
Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death, with a person dying from suicide every 43 seconds resulting in 720,000 death every year[1]. Suicidal rates are high in teenagers and young adults. The widespread use of social media through the never-ending, ever-growing internet offers a new platform to study those who are at risk of suicide. We used Machine Learning, specifically Natural Language Processing, or NLP to detect suicidal ideation through posts shared on popular social media platform, Reddit. 

1.2 Introduction
Over 16 million people attempt suicide each year and about 720,000 of them die from suicide. Suicide is the 4th leading cause of death in age 14-29[1]. Since each day more people are starting to use the internet, and social media specifically, it has emerged as a new platform to provide data for those who are at risk of suicide and a means of possible early intervention. We used dataset from Kagle, consisting of posts from popular social media platform Reddit[1]. Preprocessing and Lemmatization of the data is done, thereafter vectorization is done using  TF-IDF vectorizer. Logistic Regression is implemented to train and test the machine learning model using ‘sklearn’ library. The dataset was split into training and validation subsets, in an 80:20 ratio, ensuring the model could generalize to unseen data. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated on the validation set to assess the model's performance. The chosen Logistic Regression model achieved high recall, ensuring fewer instances of suicidal ideation went undetected. The model was saved using pickle, a python library, to be used in the future and easy accessibility
